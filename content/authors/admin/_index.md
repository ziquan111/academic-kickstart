I am a postdoctoral research fellow working with [Assistant Professor Lee Gim Hee](https://sites.google.com/site/gimheelee/) in the Computer Vision and Robot Perception (CVRP) Lab, Department of Computer Science, [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://nus.edu.sg/). I received my PhD degree as an [NUS NGS Scholar](http://www.nus.edu.sg/ngs/) in the [Adaptive Computing (AdaComp) Lab](http://adacomp.comp.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Professor David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/). Prior to PhD, I recevied my [B.Comp. (Computer Science) and B.Sci. (Applied Mathematics) (1st Class Honors)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/sp/ddp/cmam/) from NUS. I also worked closely with [Associate Professor Shengdong Zhao](http://www.shengdongzhao.com/).
